                      Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is a technology that enables the transmission of electrical energy without physical wires, utilizing electromagnetic fields to enhance the convenience and efficiency of device charging. While WPT finds applications in various domains such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and IoT devices, its transformative potential is particularly evident in the biomedical field.

                      In biomedical applications, implantable medical devices (IMDs) such as pacemakers, neurostimulators, and insulin pumps play a critical role in sustaining patients’ lives and improving their quality of life. However, these devices often rely on batteries with limited lifespans, necessitating invasive surgeries for replacement, which impose significant physical and emotional burdens on patients.

                    <p class="setence">
                      Wireless power transfer addresses these challenges by providing a reliable and continuous power supply to IMDs, reducing battery dependency, minimizing the need for surgical interventions, and enabling device miniaturization and biocompatibility. Moreover, WPT in biomedical applications must meet stringent medical standards for energy efficiency and safety while reducing risks such as infection, making it a pivotal technology for advancing healthcare innovation.
